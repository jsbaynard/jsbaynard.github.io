# About Me
I am a 23 year old computer science student with an interest in almost anything technical. I am not the best academic, but I am a very driven self-learner. For work, I am currently the assistant front end manager at a grocery store.

## Interests:
**Programming**: I am a self taught programmer of about 6 years now. I do not have many finished, polished projects -- but I have dipped my toes in a lot of different languages, tools, and frameworks. I have graveyards upon graveyards of unfinished projects, and while I have little to show for my skills, I've learned a lot. I am proficient in the following languages:
- Java
- C++
- JavaScript
- Rust
- HTML/CSS

I am still learning the following languages:
- C
- OCaml
- Haskell

**Electronics**: I have recently taken an interest in playing with microcontrollers, particularly ESP32s. Still very new to it, but I'm interested in getting to a point where I can create any type of IoT device or purpose built electronic I want.

**Video Games**: I am a big gamer. Big fan of FPS games, sandbox games, and real time strategy games. My favorite game of each listed genre would be Out of Action, Minecraft, and Stellaris.

I am also a Minecraft modder, which is why I know Java to the extent that I do. I would not use Java for anything else.

**Fitness:** I got into fitness very late but it's been very satisfying. I've been focused on lifting weights to build more muscle, but I plan on getting into cardio. 

## Websites I'd Recommend
On a daily basis I use a *lot* of different websites. Here are some of my favorites:

- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) - If you throw any fairly generic programming question at Google, you will definitely get a StackOverflow link. This has been an excellent resource for me.
- [Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org) - I am a helpless Wikipedia addict. I love jumping from article to article on just about anything. 
- [YouTube](https://youtube.com) - Obviously. Video tutorials have gotten me *started* in every technology or subject I've messed with. I typically only use one or two before diving in, but all of my interests almost always begun with a video.
- [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com) - I know it looks bad. When used ***CORRECTLY***, it is an excellent tool for research and learning. Relying on it as a crutch leads to subpar work at it's current level, and it hallucinates plenty. It's great for probing a field, technology, or subject you're interested in and learning some of the vocabulary and concepts so you can better structure queries for resources like the ones I listed above.
