        <h1>My name is Joseph S. Baynard IV</h1>
        <p>
            I am a 23 year old computer science student with an interest in almost anything technical. I am not the best academic, but I am a very driven self-learner.  I am a self taught programmer of about 6 years now fluent in 5 programming languages and very familiar with several others.
